    "name": "I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.  Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milky way, They stretched in never - ending line Along the margin of a bay: Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Out - did the sparkling waves in glee.  A Poet could not but be gay In such a jocund company! What wealth the show to me had brought; For oft, when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.", 
    "trans": ["我像一朵云一样孤独地徘徊在山谷和山丘上，突然我看到了一群，一大群金色的水仙花；湖边，树下，在微风中翩翩起舞。它们就像银河系上闪闪发光的星星一样，沿着海湾的边缘绵延不绝：一万颗星星一眼就看到了我，欢欣鼓舞地超过了闪闪发光的海浪。一个诗人在这样一个欢乐的公司里不能不是同性恋！这场演出给我带来了多少财富；因为很多时候，当我躺在沙发上空虚或陷入沉思的情绪时，它们会闪现在我内心的眼睛上，这是孤独的幸福；然后我的心充满了快乐，和水仙花一起跳舞。"]
